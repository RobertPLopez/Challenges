# Challenges

This is a repository for common PowerShell scripts for system admins. It was developed as a toolbox that can be customized by the user. The scripts created here are a combination of orginal scripts, borowed from other authors, and explinations of how different modules work. 

There are seven major categories to consider in this repository: 
  1) Challenges / Expiramnetal (This is an experamental folder where I put scripts that need testing or ideas that are not fully fleshed out)
  2) Creation scripts (Think user or OU creation)
  3) Deletion (Think user of OU deletion)
  4) Information Retrival (This folder primarily deals with network information)
  5) Movement (This folder involves moving resources between objects)
  6) Security Related (This folder is the essential scripts for any security professional. It is also the most developed out of the all folders, as this is my specialty)
  7) Stop and Start (This folder is for scripts that stop and/or start processes within a system)

In the future I would like to add the following folders: 
  1) Azure 
  2) HTML/CSS
  3) Use Cases
